      <td>Find DJ in the Eterna Forest halfway house and show him an eevee or eeveelution. You will receive a special Partner Eevee in return. This Eevee has 460 BST, will always have 6IVs, and knows Veevee Volley. If shown an eeveelution, you will also receive a special TM for a Partner Move originating from Let's Go Eevee.<br/><br/>
After this, he will move to Hearthome. Every time you earn a badge, you can show him a different eeveelution to receive a new move for your Partner Eevee.<br/><br/>
Once you defeat Maylene and go to collect a new move, DJ will gift you with a Partner Bandana: this will transform Partner Eevee into a new 480BST form with a different ability.</td>
