Luminescent Platinum is a romhack for Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. These documents are all about this mod; if you want to learn about ROM Hacking to make your own mod, check out the **ROM Hacking** tab and join the Discord.

For more detailed numbers, movelists and Pokémon availability, please visit the [google doc folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b3b3GDXKCP6KY1E0cMStnYg6y0gTPZYM). We also have [wild encounters by route](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a-NSfEgtt8kAr1cXwKkmY2SylYMs2tUG5tMSIhK0-OY/edit?usp=sharing) documentation. Boss fight documentation up to Fantina is [available here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hUVPaxr0norFBDfCRX1lp8hy3eae0zno36Cg2cMH080/edit?usp=sharing) (please make your own copy to use).

We hope you enjoy our romhack!
