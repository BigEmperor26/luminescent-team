## BST and Type Changes

- Heavily inspired by Renegade Platinum
  - In 2.0, many extra changes have been added
  - This has been done to account for additional moves, abilities, and to expand the number of Pokemon that can have viable playstyle
- [Full documentation can be found here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b3b3GDXKCP6KY1E0cMStnYg6y0gTPZYM)
  - This includes new information on additional forms

## Learnset Expansions

- Matches RP, but with many extra changes
  - Some moves were removed in Generation 8, we are in the process of restoring as many as we can, but not all of them are feasible (or worth) restoring
  - The animations of restored moves are all set to "Tackle" right now
  - This includes egg moves, TM learnsets, level up learnsets, and evolution learnsets
- Free Move Tutors have been added in the house west of Pastoria (R212)

## Abilities

- Updated to match Renegade Platinum, with additional changes from our balancing team
- Renegade Platinum had 2 ability slots. We have 3 slots, so almost every Pokemon has a new ability, with many opening up whole new playstyles.

## Grass Encounters

- Matches Renegade Platinum where possible
  - This includes honey trees
- Wild held items match Renegade Platinum
  - Vanilla bug: Honey tree Pokemon cannot hold items, meaning you will have to get leftovers from a Grand Underground Munchlax
- Swarms are not possible to change without causing crashes on hardware
  - Please let us know if this causes any Pokemon to be unobtainable
- Kecleon has been moved to simply be a grass encounter, since you can't use PokeRadar within extra-tall grass in BDSP

## Gift, Static, and Legendary Pokemon

- All Renegade Platinum static encounters have been included
  - We have added a few of our own, as well (including Crystal Onix, Costume Gengar, etc; keep your eyes out while you're adventuring!)
- All Renegade Platinum Legendary events are now included
  - These will be updated in a future update to be more exciting, with one particular event already being updated
- All static encounters and legendaries can be repeated until caught
  - This means if you faint them or run away, they will remain in place
  - This allows for fast shiny hunting as well
- All Renegade Platinum Gift Pokemon have been included (Eevee, starter reporters, randomized egg, Togepi egg, Beldum, etc)
  - Togepi egg has been adjusted into a randomized egg with a smaller pool
  - You can save before receiving every starter for shiny hunting

## Extra notes

- All egg hatch cycles have been reduced to their minimum
  - This means that all eggs will hatch within a couple steps
- Riolu evolution method changed: level up while knowing Aura Sphere.
- Salable items have been added to certain Pokémon to farm money easier
  - Clamperl now holds pearl/big pearl, Kantonian Meowths hold nuggets, and Poliwhirls hold Pearl Strings
- Spiritomb NPC requirement is removed
- Mesprit and Cresselia are no longer roamers
- All in-game trades have been updated to match Renegade Platinum
- Mew and Jirachi gifts in Floaroma have been completely disabled
