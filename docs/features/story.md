## Story

- Renegade Platinum story reproduced all the way up to the post-game legendaries
  - This does not include the Distortion World due to technical limitations of the engine
  - The battle frontier is also not (yet?) included due to the small team size for exefs modders and the relative infancy of mapping
- Intro sequence has been completely overhauled
  - You will now receive the running shoes immediately, and the bike, National Dex, PokeRadar, following Pokemon, IV Judge, DS Sounds, and every Poketch app before Roark
- Gift items match Renegade Platinum (Roark gives an evolution stone, Bike Man gives a Dawn Stone, etc.)
- This bears mentioning again the story matches Renegade Platinum - this means that Fantina is the third gym, and that Gardenia is on Route 216 - Please stop reporting this as a bug/typo
- Most cut trees, strength boulders and rock smash rocks have been removed

## Underground

- All starters unlocked in Underground from start
- Bike works in the Underground
  - Wait for Diglett/Dugtrio to disappear, as they are not able to be passed through
  - Increased Diglett/Dugtrio odds
