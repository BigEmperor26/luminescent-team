## February 8th, 2023 updates

- You only need to speak to Jan in Trainer School once to get Everlasting Candy.
- Hyper Training (boosting IVs) now available as soon as you get to Jubilife City, level cap restriction removed.
	- Graphical issue: Pokémon lower than level 100 will still be greyed out, but are fully selectable.
- Giratina cannot be caught in the Spear Pillar sequence. You must now become Champion and find it in Turnback Cave.
	- Losing to Cyrus or Giratina in the "Distortion World" should no longer be a softlock, and allow you to re-enter the space from Spear Pillar.
- Clone Pikachu should be fine if caught as either gender now. If you caught it before 2.0.0b, though, we still recommend you release it as before.
- "General Badge" Gene in Battle Area has been moved elsewhere within the same route to avoid his kecleon impression (being mostly invisible).
- Groudon moved to inside Heatran's Room.
- Kyogre moved to R213.
- The Lati duo can now properly be rebattled until caught.
- Many wild encounter issues have been fixed.
- Many trainer held item adjustments. See our documentation for information where applicable.
- Alolan Vulpix's Ice Beam and Safeguard learn levels have been swapped.
- Regional Pokémon and new evolutions have had their animations fixed, icons added, sounds inserted, and should function properly now. Anything we've missed is now something we would like reported.

### Bugs fixed

- Underground Save Bug is no longer an issue. If you were affected in 2.0.1, you should be able to load your save after updating.
- Now can only Surf after receiving Wake's badge.
- Unintentional double battles after losing to Lucian in Solaceon can be fixed by healing at a Pokémon Center. Losing to him going forward should not trigger this behavior.
- Regi trio can now be triggered by speaking with a small girl NPC in Snowpoint Pokémon Center after becoming Champion.
