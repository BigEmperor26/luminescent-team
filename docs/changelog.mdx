- Giratina cannot be caught in the Spear Pillar sequence. You must now become Champion and find it in Turnback Cave.
	- Losing to Cyrus or Giratina in the "Distortion World" should no longer be a softlock, and allow you to re-enter the space from Spear Pillar.
- Clone Pikachu should be fine if caught as either gender now. If you caught it before 2.0.0b, though, we still recommend you release it as before.
- "General Badge" Gene in Battle Area has been moved elsewhere within the same route to avoid his kecleon impression (being mostly invisible).

- Now can only Surf after receiving Wake's badge.
