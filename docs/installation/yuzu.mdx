## Installation

:::caution

Do not install any other mods with Luminescent Platinum! You will risk breaking your game!

:::

1. Download the mod [from here](https://www.nexusmods.com/pokemonbdsp/mods/1).
2. Enter the Yuzu program.
3. Right click the game.
4. Click "Open Mod Data Location".
5. Extract the contents of the mod's zip into this location (i.e., "Luminescent" that contains the exefs and romfs).
6. Change graphics setting to OpenGL (Vulkan will crash game on evolution or eggs hatching) and CPU accuracy to "accurate" (not auto).

## Notes

- THIS IS A ROMHACK, NOT AN INDEPENDENT GAME. YOU MUST ALREADY OWN BRILLIANT DIAMOND 1.3.0 TO INSTALL THIS.
- Currently, only Brilliant Diamond is supported.
- You must be on update 1.3.0 (Not 1.1.3).

## Is it working?

If you are starting a new game, the language select screen should have a gold background, and all languages except English should be crossed out. Make sure to double check that the EXP Share is off as soon as you have more than one Pokémon. If it isn't, you have a bad install. Once that's been done, you can turn it on if you so desire from the computer in a Pokémon Center.

If you have a currently running game, the Pokémon party screen should have extra options for nicknaming/changing moves of Pokémon. You can also try the EXP Share check.
