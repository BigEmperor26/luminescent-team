# Features List
## Pokémon Changes
### BST and Type Changes
- Heavily inspired by Renegade Platinum.
  - In 2.0, many extra changes have been added.
  - This has been done to account for additional moves, abilities, and to expand the number of Pokemon that can have viable playstyle.
- [Full pokedex documentation can be found here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b3b3GDXKCP6KY1E0cMStnYg6y0gTPZYM).
  - This includes new information on additional forms.
### Learnset Expansions
- Matches RP, but with many extra changes.
  - Some moves were removed in Generation 8, we are in the process of restoring as many as we can, but not all of them are feasible (or worth) restoring.
  	- The animations of restored moves are all set to "Tackle" right now.
  - This includes egg moves, TM learnsets, level up learnsets, and evolution learnsets.
- Free Move Tutors have been added in the house west of Pastoria (R212).
### Abilities
- Updated to match Renegade Platinum, with additional changes from our balancing team.
	- Renegade Platinum had 2 ability slots. We have 3 slots, so almost every Pokemon has a new ability, with many opening up whole new playstyles.
### Grass Encounters
- Matches Renegade Platinum where possible.
  - This includes honey trees.
- Wild held items match Renegade Platinum.
  - Vanilla bug: Honey tree Pokemon cannot hold items, meaning you will have to get leftovers from a Grand Underground Munchlax.
- Swarms are not possible to change without causing crashes on hardware.
  - Please let us know if this causes any Pokemon to be unobtainable.
- Kecleon has been moved to simply be a grass encounter, since you can't use PokeRadar within extra-tall grass in BDSP.
### Gift, Static, and Legendary Pokemon
- All Renegade Platinum [static encounters](special-events/static.mdx) have been included.
  - We have added a few of our own, as well (including Crystal Onix, Costume Gengar, etc; keep your eyes out while you're adventuring!).
- All Renegade Platinum [Legendary events](special-events/legendaries.mdx) are now included.
  - These will be updated in a future update to be more exciting, with one particular event already being updated.
- All static encounters and legendaries can be repeated until caught.
  - This means if you faint them or run away, they will remain in place.
  - This allows for fast shiny hunting as well.
- All [Renegade Platinum Gift Pokemon](special-events/gifts.mdx) have been included (Eevee, starter reporters, randomized egg, Togepi egg, Beldum, etc).
  - Togepi egg has been adjusted into a randomized egg with a smaller pool.
  - You can save before receiving every starter for shiny hunting.
### Extra notes
- All egg hatch cycles have been reduced to their minimum.
  - This means that all eggs will hatch within a couple steps.
- Riolu evolution method changed: level up while knowing Aura Sphere.
- [All trade evolutions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10dopXJTH0HPhvo7J2mE_yFq1W-JKhtPycU1QhlJvVe0/edit#gid=21128662) can now be achieved via level-up or using trade items as evolution stones.

  - [Boss documentation up to Fantina](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hUVPaxr0norFBDfCRX1lp8hy3eae0zno36Cg2cMH080/edit?usp=sharing) has been provided; full documentation will not be revealed until one week after 2.0 Final's release.
- All Gym Guide hint dialogue has been changed to now talk about any new gimmicks introduced.
- Trainer placement adjusted to match RP counterparts, allowing for more potential double-battles!
- Boss fights (Barry, Gym Leaders, Cyrus in the Distortion Room, and Elite Four) now pick between one of four teams randomly.
- All trainer teams have 25 IVs and neutral natures.
- After the Cyrus fight in Celestic, all important battles (Ace Trainers, Gym Trainers, Gym Leaders, Galactic Commanders, Cyrus, Rival, E4 and Cynthia fights) have 31 IVs and complimentary natures and EV spreads.
- An experience trainer has been added to Eterna City before the Jupiter Fight if you do not wish to use the new Everlasting Candy.
- EXP/EV Trainer in Solaceon Nursery.
  - Level sets are based on story flags, and will unlock progressively higher leveled teams of Blissey the farther you progress in the storyline.

## Item Changes

- TMs are no longer purchasable, due to being obtained through the course of the game.
- Veilstone 3F now sells evolution stones + Hard Stone and Everstone.
- Non-stone evolution items purchasable in Snowpoint, at Mindy's house.

  - Allows for additional route encounters, like the dual slot system from DDPt (two 10% slots are overwritten, or one 30% slot for surfing).
  - What flowers you choose has no bearing on the Pokémon you'll encounter in 2.0. However, it will completely change what you encounter when full National Dex is implemented in 3.0, so choose accordingly.
  - More flowers are unlocked as you progress the story.

## Story & Underground Changes
### Story
- Renegade Platinum story reproduced all the way up to the post-game legendaries.
  - This does not include the Distortion World due to technical limitations of the engine.
  - The battle frontier is also not (yet?) included due to the small team size for exefs modders and the relative infancy of mapping.
- Intro sequence has been completely overhauled.
  - You will now receive the running shoes immediately, and the bike, National Dex, PokeRadar, following Pokemon, IV Judge, DS Sounds, and every Poketch app before Roark.
- Gift items match Renegade Platinum (Roark gives an evolution stone, Bike Man gives a Dawn Stone, etc.).
- This bears mentioning again the story matches Renegade Platinum - this means that Fantina is the third gym, and that Gardenia is on Route 216.
  - Please stop reporting this as a bug/typo.
- Most cut trees, strength boulders and rock smash rocks have been removed.
### Underground
- All starters unlocked in Underground from start.
- Bike works in the Underground.
