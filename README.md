# [Luminescent Team Website](https://lumi.mrhe.ro/)

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ npm install
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

This site is automatically built and deployed to GitHub Pages using an Action.  
Every commit to main will build and deploy a new version of the site.  
There is also an Action to attempt building the site on any pull requests made targeting main.
