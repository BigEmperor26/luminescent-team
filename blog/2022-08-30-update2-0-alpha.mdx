Trainers, the time has come.
We apologize it's taken so long, but this essentially took a full rebuild of the entire storyline of the game. There's barely a single place in the game that hasn't been re-scripted. Thank you all so much for your patience.

Before you download, however, please read this:

This is 2.0 Alpha, and as an alpha, there are a few things to note.

1. National Dex is not included. This remains true for the full release of 2.0 as well - we are hard at work getting it ready, but it's fair to say this is going to be one of our biggest challenges to get ready, figure out a proper distribution method, and release something that we are proud of. It's also worth mentioning that Sylveon is still not included.

2. Forms are not included (for the most part). We're still working on exefs challenges, so this is a little all over the place. For example, <Spoiler revealedColor='transparent'>Armored Mewtwo</Spoiler> is battleable, but not catchable (obtainable) at this time. Hisuian Growlithe is not in the wild yet due to needing a data restructure, etc. Do note, there's a couple of fun forms to find scattered throughout the game, but don't expect all of the ones we've shown off, and definitely don't expect any regionals.

3. You will encounter bugs. Please report them in #üêõÔ∏±support . The main point of this alpha is to get our biggest update yet polished and ready for prime-time. Please back up your saves often.

4. IF YOU ASK FOR THE ROM (NSP, XCI, UPDATE 1.3, OR PROD.KEYS) YOU WILL BE INSTANTLY BANNED, NO QUESTIONS ASKED
