Please back them up.</li><li>Pikatwo (the clone Pikachu) in the last release was bugged, please release it.</li><li>This update breaks our compatibility with our PkHax-Luminescent branch. No ETA on when it will work again.</li><li>After a successful update, please visit a Pok√©mon Center and heal to update your save. Any bug reports and other help requests that have yet to do this will be ignored.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="luminescent-update-20-beta">LUMINESCENT UPDATE 2.0 BETA:<a class="hash-link" href="#luminescent-update-20-beta" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h2><p>üö®üö®üö®<br>

<!-- -->üö®üö®üö®<br>
<!-- -->Surprise: this beta includes all regional forms and attached evolutions of gens 1-4 pokemon! Think Sylveon, Alolan Marowak and Mr Rime, but not White Stripe Basculin or Hisuian Braviary. A list of their balance changes, a page of evolution methods, and a chart of their locations will be coming soon. When playing, keep in mind that the special incense items you receive will make no difference during your 2.0 playthrough; it will only matter when the full National Dex Update happens in 3.0. Make your choices with that in mind.</p><p>That said, this is not the final form of these pokemon we are implementing. </p><ul><li>Many have texturing issues that need further adjustment</li><li>You won't be able to see them at all on the evolution screen </li><li>Certain battle, idle or walking animations simply don't work (but also don't crash)</li><li>Many have "egg" as their party icon</li><li>They don't make sounds
Any bug reports to these effects will be closed without conversation. We figured you guys would want them janky but usable over perfected but waiting a lot longer.</li></ul><p>Without further ado, here's the whole lineup of our new friends!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="other">Other<a class="hash-link" href="#other" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>‚Ä¢ 700 Sylveon</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="alola">Alola<a class="hash-link" href="#alola" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>‚Ä¢ 19-2 Rattata ‚Üí 20-2 Raticate

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Trainers, the time has come.
We apologize it's taken so long, but this essentially took a full rebuild of the entire storyline of the game. There's barely a single place in the game that hasn't been re-scripted. Thank you all so much for your patience.</p><p>Before you download, however, please read this:</p><p>This is 2.0 Alpha, and as an alpha, there are a few things to note.</p><ol><li><p>National Dex is not included. This remains true for the full release of 2.0 as well - we are hard at work getting it ready, but it's fair to say this is going to be one of our biggest challenges to get ready, figure out a proper distribution method, and release something that we are proud of. It's also worth mentioning that Sylveon is still not included.</p></li><li><p>Forms are not included (for the most part). We're still working on exefs challenges, so this is a little all over the place. For example, Armored Mewtwo is battleable, but not catchable (obtainable) at this time. Hisuian Growlithe is not in the wild yet due to needing a data restructure, etc. Do note, there's a couple of fun forms to find scattered throughout the game, but don't expect all of the ones we've shown off, and definitely don't expect any regionals.</p></li><li><p>You will encounter bugs. Please report them in #üêõÔ∏±support . The main point of this alpha is to get our biggest update yet polished and ready for prime-time. Please back up your saves often.</p></li><li><p>IF YOU ASK FOR THE ROM (NSP, XCI, UPDATE 1.3, OR PROD.KEYS) YOU WILL BE INSTANTLY BANNED, NO QUESTIONS ASKED</p></li></ol>]]></content>
